"""The shortcuts that work whichever application is in front: a new note, the
Stickle window, and every note out of sight for a while.

They do what the command line can ask for (see stickle.platform.instance).
The defaults can be changed, or turned off, on each computer. A shortcut the
system refuses (another application has it) is left unregistered and said
so in the Stickle window for as long as it lasts, never in a pop-up.

Under Wayland the desktop keeps them instead, through its portal: Stickle
offers the defaults once, the desktop asks the user, and they are changed in
the desktop's own settings; Stickle only shows which keys the desktop gave.
