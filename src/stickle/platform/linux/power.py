"""Notice when Linux is about to sleep, through systemd-logind.

logind sends PrepareForSleep(true) on the system bus just before suspending
and PrepareForSleep(false) after waking. Without logind (or without a system
bus) nothing is watched; saving a second after the last keystroke still
bounds what a sudden power loss could take.
